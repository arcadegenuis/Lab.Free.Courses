## **MLOps: Introduction to Model Evaluation Quiz**

1. **An ML engineer is working on a large-scale project that involves training multiple machine learning models. They are evaluating a new model and want to ensure it can adapt to changes in real-world data over time. Which of the following evaluation strategies should the engineer prioritize?**  
   - Continuous evaluation to monitor model performance on new data after deployment and retrain as needed.

2. **An ML engineer is developing a customer churn prediction model. During model evaluation, they notice the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Which of the following concepts best describes this issue?**  
   - Overfitting

3. **A data science team is struggling to manage the lifecycle of their machine learning models from development to deployment. They face challenges with inconsistent model performance, difficulty tracking model versions, and a lack of collaboration between team members. Which of the following best describes how adopting an MLOps approach with Vertex AI could address these issues?**  
   - MLOps with Vertex AI would provide a structured framework for managing the entire ML lifecycle, promoting collaboration, enabling version control, and improving model performance consistency.

4. **You're working on a machine learning project and need to evaluate your model's performance. Which of the following scenarios would benefit from using Vertex AI's model evaluation service? Select all that apply.**  
   - You are concerned that your model may be overfitting to your training data and want to assess its performance on unseen data.  
   - You need to monitor your deployed model's performance over time and detect potential issues like concept drift.  
   - You have a large dataset and need to compare multiple model versions to find the best one.

## **MLOps: Model Evaluation for Generative AI Quiz**

1. **During the evaluation of an LLM, you find that the model often produces responses that sound fluent and grammatical but are factually incorrect. Which of the following evaluation challenges does this example illustrate?**  
   - Model complexity and decision-making

2. **A company is using a generative AI model to write marketing copy. Which evaluation approach would help them ensure that the generated content is both creative and relevant to their target audience?**  
   - Combining automated metrics for diversity and relevance with human evaluation for creativity and brand alignment.

3. **Which component of an LLM block is responsible for storing and retrieving past interactions with the model to provide context for future requests?**  
   - Memory

4. **You're tasked with evaluating multiple versions of a language model for summarizing news articles. You want to know which model produces the most informative and coherent summaries. Which evaluation type would be most appropriate?**  
   - Ranking evaluation: have human evaluators rank the summaries from different models based on their overall quality.

5. **An ML engineer is tasked with selecting the best-performing image classification model from three candidates, all trained on the same dataset. Their primary goal is to understand how each model performs in real-world scenarios and identify areas for potential improvement. Which evaluation approach would be most effective for this initial assessment?**  
   - Pointwise evaluation, focusing on the absolute performance of each model and identifying its strengths and weaknesses.

6. **When using evaluation methods like BLEU or ROUGE for LLM assessment, which of the following challenges is most likely to arise if the reference dataset is limited or biased?**  
   - The evaluation may underestimate the model's true capabilities because the reference data doesn't cover the full range of acceptable responses.

7. **You're evaluating a language model designed to generate creative stories. Which of the following evaluation approaches would be most relevant? Select all that apply.**  
   - Assessing the diversity and originality of the generated stories.  
   - Calculating the perplexity of the model's output.
