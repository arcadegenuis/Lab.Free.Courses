## ✅ Gen AI: Unlock Foundational Concepts

--

### 📗 Core Gen AI Concepts

1. ✅ Data ingestion and preparation > Model training > Model deployment > Model management  
2. ✅ Inconsistent formats and labeling can confuse the model and hinder learning.  
3. ✅ By interacting with their environment and receiving feedback.  
4. ✅ Collecting, cleaning, and transforming raw data.  
5. ✅ A complex mathematical structure that processes inputs to generate outputs.  
6. ✅ A collection of customer reviews in the form of free-text paragraphs.

### 📘 Foundation Models

1. ✅ To integrate human expertise into the ML process, especially for tasks requiring judgment or context.  
2. ✅ Grounding, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and humans in the loop (HITL).  
3. ✅ Large language model (LLM)  
4. ✅ To connect the AI's output to verifiable sources of information.  
5. ✅ Diffusion model

### 📗 Building AI Securely and Responsibly

1. ✅ It introduces biased outcomes and unfair results.  
2. ✅ Regularly audit the model's performance to identify and mitigate any biases that may emerge over time.  
   ✅ Train the model on a dataset that includes a diverse range of applicants, ensuring representation across different demographics and socioeconomic backgrounds.  
3. ✅ To ensure AI systems are used responsibly and do not cause harm.  
4. ✅ Safeguarding training data and model parameters from unauthorized access.  
5. ✅ To establish security standards for building and deploying AI responsibly, addressing the unique challenges and threats in the AI landscape.
